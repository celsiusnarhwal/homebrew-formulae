# Houkago Tea Tap

The Houkago Tea Tap is the repository for [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) distributions of my software.

```bash
brew tap celsiusnarhwal/htt
```

For a list of the Tap's offerings, see [Tap Contents](contents.md)[.](https://youtu.be/plAY6-JX7hc)

## Bottles

The Tap's formulae are currently bottled for macOS Big Sur and macOS Monterey on both Intel and Apple silicon. Users on
other version of macOS (including Ventura) or Linux will be relegated to building from source.

Note that there is a delay between the release a new version of a formula and the availability of bottles for it.
Bottles are published automatically to [Releases](/releases); check there for the latest updates.
