# Houkago Tea Tap

The Houkago Tea Tap is the repository for Homebrew distributions of my software.

```bash
brew tap celsiusnarhwal/htt
```

Formulae can be found inside the [Formula](/Formula) folder. For information on specific formulae in this tap,
refer to that formula's repository (usually `celsiusnarhwal/formula-name`).
